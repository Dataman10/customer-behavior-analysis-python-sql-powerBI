# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📌 **Overview**

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover insights that can drive strategic business decisions.
I performed **data analysis from start to finish** — including data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and dashboard creation.
The goal was to understand customer segments, revenue trends, and purchasing patterns using a real-world dataset.

## 🪜 **Project Steps**

### 1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

* Imported dataset in Python using `pandas`.
* Examined structure with `df.info()` and summary statistics.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**

* Handled missing values using median imputation.
* Standardized column names and data types.
* Removed outliers and duplicates.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Analyzed purchase trends, age groups, and product preferences.
* Visualized correlations between gender, revenue, and product ratings.

### 4. **SQL Integration (PostgreSQL)**

* Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL.
* Executed analytical SQL queries to derive:

  * Revenue by gender
  * Discount impact on spending
  * Top-rated products by category
  * Customer loyalty and subscription insights

### 5. **Power BI Dashboard**

* Connected PostgreSQL database to Power BI.
* Built interactive dashboards showing:

  * Revenue trends
  * Age group contributions
  * Product ratings
  * Discount and subscription analysis

### 6. **Report & Presentation**

* Created an executive report summarizing key insights.
* Designed a professional presentation using **Gamma** for clear visual storytelling.

## 📊 **Dashboard Highlights**

* **Male customers** generate 68% of total revenue.
* **Young adults** lead in overall purchases.
* **80% loyalty rate** among customers.
* **Top-rated products:** Gloves, Sandals, Boots.
* Key opportunities: Increase subscriptions and optimize discount strategy.
